## Overall and Data Previw
This project use classroom.dta dataset provided by Professor Marc Scott.  
The classroom dataset has three levels of nesting: schools, classrooms within schools and students within those classrooms. In this sample, there are 107 schools, a total of 312 classrooms across all schools, and 1190 students total. Within a school, there are between 2 and 31 students sampled.
